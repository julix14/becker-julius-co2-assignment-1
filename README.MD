   - A nice list of at least 3 risks associated with AI with pictures and descriptions of
     each
4. Quiz page: This page includes a simple quiz to help website visitors assess their
   knowledge when it comes to the benefits and risks associated with AI:
   - The quiz must have 5 questions: one true/false, three multiple choice, and one
     text questions. The total score is 10.
   - All questions can be skipped, but the visitor cannot go back to the previous
     question.
   - When the visitor completes the quiz by answering at least one question, a
     summary of all questions with their provided answers and solutions is
     displayed. Also, the grade of out 10 is displayed.
   - Finally, the visitor is asked whether they would like to receive the summary via
     email. If they select yes, a text field is displayed to collect their email address. <sup>1</sup>
5. Proper navigation between the pages must be implemented.
